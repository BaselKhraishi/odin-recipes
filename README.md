Odin-Recipes is a simple website I have developed that is meant to apply everything that I have learned so far in HTML. This project helped me practice working with different texts, lists, and implementing links and images as well as how to use github. The hardest part about this project would definitely be remembering all the commands that I needed. I found myself having to look up the commands I needed pretty often which made this take longer than required however this would probably get better the more I practice and complete projects.
