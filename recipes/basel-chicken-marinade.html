    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This recipe is Basel's chicken thigh marinade. You can serve this chicken with any rice based dish or with a salad. Each bite is juicy and packed full of flavour!
    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
        <li>Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Rosemary</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Chicken Thighs/Breast</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Pat your chicken dry with a paper towel and put them in a large bowl. Add grated garlic, squeezed lemon, tomato paste, olive oil, salt, pepper, paprika, rosemary, and oregano. Let this marinate overnight if possible but for a minimum of 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Set your pan to medium high. To check if the pan is hot enough, add some drops of water to the pan. If the water drops bounce around in the pan, you are ready to start cooking. (Note: To make cooking easier you can slice the thicker pieces in half or cut them all into small chunks to avoid undercooking the chicken.) </li>
      <li>Flip the chicken when you can see the bottom side develop a crust. This should be at around 5 minutes. Repeat for the other side. Keep flipping every few minutes after the first flip to make sure that the sides dont burn. To check to see if the chicken is done cooking, take the thickest piece off the pan and cut it in half. If it's cooked you can take all the others off of the pan.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I typically like to serve this with rice and a salad. This makes it a well rounded and nutrional meal that is good for people trying to eat cleaner.</p>
